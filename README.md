stock price prediction using random forest classifier
This repository contains code and resources for predicting stock prices using a Random Forest Classifier.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the future prices of stocks based on historical data. i used the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method known for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and making accurate predictions.

# Key Features

- Utilizes historical stock price data to train the Random Forest Classifier model.
- Preprocesses the data by applying feature engineering techniques and handling missing values.
- Divides the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Trains the Random Forest Classifier on the training set and evaluates its performance.
- Predicts future stock prices using the trained model.
- Provides visualizations of the predicted prices and model performance metrics.
